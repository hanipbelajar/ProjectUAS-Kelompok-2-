[Judul: Back To Friends - sombr]
Cause the feeling makes me weak
Kicking off the covers
I see the ceiling, while you're looking down at me
How can we go back to being friends
When we just shared a bed?
How can you look at me and pretend
I'm someone you've never met?
It was last December
You were layin' on my chest
I still remember
I was scared to take a breath, didn't want you to move your head
